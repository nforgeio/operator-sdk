    /// <remarks>
    /// <para>
    /// This class implements leader election uses a <see cref="V1Lease"/> object
    /// to manage leadership election by trying to ensure that only one leader is
    /// active at any time.
    /// </para>
    /// <note>
    /// Although this class tries fairly hard to ensure that only a single leader
    /// exists at any time, it is possible for two or more instances to believe 
    /// they are the leader due to network partitions or latency issues.
    /// </note>
    /// <para>
    /// A client only acts on timestamps captured locally to infer the state of the
    /// leader election. The client does not consider timestamps in the leader
    /// election record to be accurate because these timestamps may not have been
    /// produced by the local clock. The implemention does not depend on their
    /// accuracy and only uses their change to indicate that another client has
    /// renewed the leader lease. Thus the implementation is tolerant to arbitrary
    /// clock skew, but is not tolerant to arbitrary clock skew rate.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// However, the level of tolerance to skew rate can be configured by setting
    /// <see cref="LeaderElectionConfig.RenewDeadline"/> and <see cref="LeaderElectionConfig.LeaseDuration"/>
    /// appropriately. The tolerance expressed as a maximum tolerated ratio of time 
    /// passed on the fastest node to time passed on the slowest node can be approximately
    /// achieved with a configuration that sets the same ratio of LeaseDuration to RenewDeadline.
    /// For example if a user wanted to tolerate some nodes progressing forward in time
    /// twice as fast as other nodes, the user could set LeaseDuration to 60 seconds and 
    /// RenewDeadline to 30 seconds.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// While not required, some method of clock synchronization between nodes in the
    /// cluster is highly recommended. It's important to keep in mind when configuring
    /// this client that the tolerance to skew rate varies inversely to control-plane node
    /// availability.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// Larger clusters often need a more lenient SLA for API latency. This should be
    /// taken into account when configuring the client. The rate of leader transitions
    /// should be monitored and RetryPeriod and LeaseDuration should be increased
    /// until the rate is stable and acceptably low. It's important to keep in mind
    /// when configuring this client that the tolerance to API latency varies inversely
    /// to control-plane availability.
