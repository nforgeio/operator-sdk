# NOTE: This is script works only for maintainers with proper credentials.

# Publishes DEBUG builds of the NeonForge Nuget packages to the repo
# at https://nuget-dev.neoncloud.io so intermediate builds can be shared 
# by maintainers.
#
# USAGE: pwsh -f neonkube-nuget-dev.ps1 [OPTIONS]
#
# OPTIONS:
#
#       -local          - Publishes to C:\nc-nuget-local
#       -localversion   - Use the local version number (emergency only)
#       -dirty          - Use GitHub sources for SourceLink even if local repo is dirty
#       -release        - Do a RELEASE build instead of DEBUG (the default)
#       -restore        - Just restore the CSPROJ files after cancelling publish
#
# Generally, you'll use this script without any options to publish to the private
# feed in the neonCLOUD headend using the atomic counter there to update VERSION
# numbers, especially for shared branches and especially the master branch.
#
# During development on private branches, you may wish to use a local feed
# instead, which is simply the C:\nc-nuget-local folder.  This will be much 
# faster and will reduce the accumulation of packages in our private feed.
# Use the [-local] option for this.
#
# NOTE: The script writes the package publication version to:
#
#           $/build/nuget/version.txt
#
# EMERGENCY USE:
# 
# By default, [-local] will still use the atomic versioner service in the
# headend to increment counters so that these versions monotonically increase
# across all packages published by all developers.  In an emergency such as
# when the headend services are down or when you're trying to work offline
# or on a poor connection, you can combine [-local-version] with [-local].
#
# This indicates that version numbers will be obtained from local counter files
# within the local feed folder:
#
#   C:\nc-nuget-local\neonKUBE.version.txt
#   C:\nc-nuget-local\neonSDK.version.txt
#
# These simply hold the next version as an integer on the first line for 
# each set of packages.  You'll need to manually initialize these files
# with reasonable version numbers greater than any previously published
# packages.
#
# Once the emergency is over, you must to manually update the versions
# on the headend to be greater than any version published locally by any
# developer on the team and then republish all packages using the new
# version.

# $todo(jefflill):
#
# We should update the versioner to manage the entire version, not just
# incrementing the PATCH part of the version.  This would make it easier
# to recover from emergency use of the [-local-version] switch by simply
# needing to increment the MINOR component of the versions without needing
# to coordinate with developers to determine the maximum version published.
